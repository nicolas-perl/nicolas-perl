## About me
Ever since I attended the technical college in Kaindorf, I have been interested in the topic of computers, problem-solving and what is behind intelligent systems and current technology. Over time, I discovered that my strengths lie in the creative side of computer science, particularly in UI and UX design. This field allows me to combine my technical knowledge with artistic problem-solving, enabling me to craft intuitive and impactful solutions that enhance user interaction and shape the technology of tomorrow. :calling:

I am a dedicated Information and Computer Engineering Master's student at TU Graz. With a strong foundation in web development and a keen eye for user-centric design, I specialize in creating intuitive and innovative digital solutions. I aim to further develop my skills in cutting-edge technologies while contributing to impactful projects. :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

Outside of coding and design, I consider myself as a passionate travel photographer. From rugged landscapes to unique moments, photography allows me to tell stories that inspire and connect. My camera lens is my gateway to capturing the wonders of nature, thrilling adventures, and captivating travel stories. Besides that I thrive also on all sorts of adventures and outdoor activities such as hiking, snowshoeing, running or cycling. Combining spontaneous road trips with scenic hikes and immersing myself in the beauty of nature is my favorite way to spend my time. :deciduous_tree:
